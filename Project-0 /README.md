## Overview

This project demonstrates **best practices for preparing raw datasets for analysis**, including:

- Cleaning and preprocessing messy or inconsistent data  
- Handling missing values, redundant data, and incorrect entries  
- Numerization and discretization of variables  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Data visualization for actionable insights  

The project ensures reproducibility and a consistent development environment using **DevContainers**.

---

## Why This Project?

Real-world data is rarely clean or consistent. This portfolio demonstrates techniques to:

- Identify and handle missing or incorrect values  
- Standardize and transform data formats  
- Detect and remove redundant or duplicate data  
- Transform variables for analysis using numerization and discretization  
- Generate visual insights to support data-driven decisions  

This makes it a great showcase for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization workflows.

---

## Features

- Comprehensive **data cleaning workflow**  
- Handling **redundant data, numerization, and discretization**  
- Exploratory data analysis with **Python and Jupyter notebooks**  
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly**  
- **Containerized development environment** for reproducibility (DevContainers + Docker)  

---

## Requirements

- **Docker Desktop** installed  
- **VS Code** with **Remote - Containers** extension  
- **Python 3.8+** (inside DevContainer)  

Dependencies (auto-installed via DevContainer):

```bash
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
jupyterlab
notebook
scikit-learn
````

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Data-Exploration-Portfolio.git
cd Data-Exploration-Portfolio
```

2. **Open in VS Code**

* VS Code should prompt: **“Reopen in Container” → Click it**
* The DevContainer will build and install all dependencies automatically

3. **Alternative without container (optional):**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Open a terminal in VS Code (inside the DevContainer).
2. Launch Jupyter Lab:

```bash
jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root
```

3. Copy the URL with the token from the terminal and open it in your browser.
4. Open your notebook (e.g., `Data-Cleaning.ipynb`) and run cells step by step.
